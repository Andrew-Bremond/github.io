    <p style="font-size:1vw"> This is the first project that we have done. In this project my group wanted to recreate the sky during the night. We are able to see space, with stars, the moon, and mountain peaks. I came up with the main idea, and then as a team we added more and more details. I made the mountains and added some snow on it to make it more detailed.
