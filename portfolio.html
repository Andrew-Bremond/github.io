    <h1> Project 1 "Starry Night"

    <p style="font-size:1vw"> This is the first project that we have done. In this project my group wanted to recreate the sky during the night. We are able to see space, with stars, the moon, and mountain peaks. I came up with the main idea, and then as a team we added more and more details. I made the mountains and added some snow on it to make it more detailed.

    <h2 style="font-size:2vw"> Project 2 "Racing Coins"
    <br> <img src="Comp Sci images/project2_fin.JPG" height="250">
	    
    <p style="font-size:1vw"> In this project, as a team we decided to create a game about collecting coins. We race time, and try to collect as many coins as possible. I came up with the project design, and I was responsible for the vehicle and its movement. I used the turtle and I made it work so that it will move when the player presses down on the arrow keys on their keyboard. As everyone was tasked to do their own part, we successfully managed to put everything together.

    <p style="font-size:1vw"> The third project, we made an interactive story about a lonley monster who wants to make friends. I came up with the main idea and the story about the monster going around in the town.
